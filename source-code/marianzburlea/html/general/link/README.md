## Notes

The `<link>` HTML element specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and icons for the home screen and apps on mobile devices) among other things.

`<link>` tag goes inside the `<head>` tag.

### Simple example

```html:
<link href="main.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

This simple example provides the path to the stylesheet inside an **href** attribute, and a **rel** attribute with a value of stylesheet. The **rel** stands for "relationship", and is probably one of the key features of the `<link>` element â€” the value denotes how the item being linked to is related to the containing document.
