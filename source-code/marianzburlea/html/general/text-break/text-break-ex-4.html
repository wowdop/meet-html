        Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
        1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
        make a type specimen book.

        <hr style="height: 2px; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 132)" />

        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
        electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. <br />It was
        popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
        like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
