<h1>Some more infos about the <b>hr</b> & <b>br</b> tags</h1>

<h2>
  As I previously talked about these tags with my colleagues, we actually found
  a whole array of uses for the so said tags. But, you shouldn't abuse these
  tags.Therefore let's give some examples:

      Ireland
    </address>

      "Nequeh4porro quisquam est qui dolorem ipsum quia dolor sit amet,
      consectetur, adipisci velit..." "There is no one who loves pain itself,
      who seeks after it and wants to have it, simply because it is pain..."

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially
      unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset
      sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop
      publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem
      Ipsum.
