<h1>
  This is the most simple example of the use of <b>br</b> and <b>hr</b> tags
</h1>

<h2>
  The <b>br</b> tag is used to insert a "line break" which means the text/image
  following the tag will be moved to the next line.
  <br />
  This is an invisible separator for the ones that see the web version, but it
  is seen and read by the browser and applied as an occupied space in page.
</h2>

<p>In between this 2 lines the break occurs.</p>
<br />
<p>In between this 2 lines the break occurs.</p>

<h3>The Code: &lt;br/&gt;</h3>

<h2>
  The <b>hr</b> tag is used to insert horizontal line that can divide the
  information into sections.
  <br />
  This is a visible separator for both the one seeing the web version and the
  ones that seeing the code behind it.
</h2>

<hr />

<h3>The Code: &lt;hr/&gt;</h3>

<p>
  In case you feel courageous you can play with styling the <b>hr</b> even if I
  don't deem it necessary.
</p>
<hr
  style="height: 20px; border-radius: 1rem; background-color: rgb(0, 255, 132)"
