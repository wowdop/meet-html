  This page shares my best articles to read on topics like<br />
  health, happiness, creativity, productivity and more. <br />
  The central question that drives my work is, “How can we live better?” <br />
  To answer that question, I like to write about science-based ways to solve
  practical problems. <br />
  You’ll find interesting articles to read on topics like how to stop
  procrastinating as well as personal recommendations like my list of the best
  books to read and my minimalist travel guide. <br />
