    <strong>What is random text generator?</strong>
    <b>Random Text Generator is a web application which provides</b> true random
    text which you can use in your documents or web designs. How does it work?
    First we took many books available on project Gutenberg and stored their
    contents in a database.
  </p>

  <p>
    <u>Then a computer</u> algorithm takes the words we stored earlier and
    shuffles them into sentences and paragraphs. The algorithm takes care to
    create text that looks similar to an ordinary book but without any real
    meaning. The <del>motive</del> <ins>reason</ins> we want our text to be
    meaningless is that we want the person viewing the resulting random text to
    focus on the design we are presenting, rather than try to read and
    understand the text.

    <b>It's better</b> than Lorem ipsum <s>because</s> it can produce text in
    many languages and in particular: Chinese, Dutch, English, Finnish, French,
    German, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Japanese, Latin, Polish, Portuguese,
    Russian, Serbian and Spanish. <u>Also</u> when you use plain Lorem ipsum
    text, your design will look like a million other designs out there. With
    Random Text Generator your designs will look <i>more unique</i>
    <em>while still containing text</em> which truly <u>means nothing</u>.
