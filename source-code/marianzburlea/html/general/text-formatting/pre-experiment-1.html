<p>The code looks like this:</p>

<pre>
&lt;pre
  role="img"
  aria-label="A guy made of brackets with smiling face
  with sunglases head and two backhands index finger pointing right to a tombstone"&gt;

  Here lies

      John the Bravest

                 \👉\👉  🪦
                        HTML
  After he &lt;b&gt;won&lt;/b&gt; the battle with it.

&lt;/pre&gt;
</pre>

<p>As you can see, it kept all the spaces and line breaks</p>
