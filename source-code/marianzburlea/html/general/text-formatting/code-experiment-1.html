<h1>Let's talk about <i>code</i> tag</h1>

<p>Look at this <code>text</code>.</p>

<p>
  It was written inside the <b>code</b> tag and made it look different than the
  rest of the page.
</p>

<p>We can also talk about a line of CSS by using <b>code</b>:</p>

<code>background-color: red</code>

<p>
  If you write this in your style for an element, the element will then have a
  red background color.
</p>

<p>Code example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;code&gt;background-color: red&lt;/code&gt;
</pre>
