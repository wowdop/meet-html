# Meet the pre & code tags

## Research pre tag

I did some research on Google

[html pre tag w3](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+pre+tag+w3)

and found

[HTML pre tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_pre.asp)

and

[html pre tag mdn](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+pre+tag+mdn)

and found

[HTML pre tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/pre)

## Notes

The `<pre>` tag defines preformatted text.

Text in a `<pre>` element preserves both spaces and line breaks. The text will be displayed exactly as written in the HTML source code.

You can also use this tag if you want to display a piece of your code as well.

`<pre>` tag has two attributes that you can use if the content that is inside is kinda obscure.
For example, if someone has a disability and requires a screenreader and you display an emoji, the user will not be able to find out what it is displayed without those two attributes:

| **Attribute**         | **Value** |
| --------------------- | --------- |
| <ins>role</ins>       | img       |
| <ins>aria-label</ins> | text      |

<ins>**`role`**</ins> needs to be written exactly like this: <ins>role="img"</ins>

<ins>**`aria-label`**</ins> represents the description that will be read by the screenreader. You can write it as brief as you want to explain what you have displayed.

## Example list

###Â Example 1

```html:
<pre
  role="img"
  aria-label="A guy made of brackets with smiling face with sunglases head and two backhands index finger pointing right to a tombstone"
>
  Here lies

      John the Bravest
          with his HTML
                 ðŸ˜Ž
                 \ðŸ‘‰\ðŸ‘‰  ðŸª¦
                        HTML
  After he <b>won</b> the battle with it.
</pre>
```

###Â Example 2

```html:
<pre>
  <h1>Making use of the <i>pre</i> html tag</h1>
  <p>This will all be displayed below in a <b>pre tag</b></p>
</pre>
```

###Â Example 3

```html:
<pre role="img" aria-label="ASCII COW">
  __________________________
      &lt;I love HTML &gt;
                  ..... (Â¯`vÂ´Â¯)â™¥
                  .......â€¢.Â¸.â€¢
                  ....Â¸.â€¢Â´
                  ... (
                  â˜»/
                  /â–Œâ™¥â™¥
                  / \ â™¥â™¥
</pre>
```

## Research code tag

I did some research on Google

[html code tag w3](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+code+tag+w3)

and found

[HTML code tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_code.asp)

and

[html code tag mdn](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+code+tag+mdn)

and found

[HTML code tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/code)

## Notes

The `<code>` tag is used to define a piece of computer code. The content inside is displayed in the browser's default monospace font.
It might seem very similar to `<pre>` tag, but it does not keep all spaces etc like it.

## Example list

###Â Example 1

```html:
<p>Look at this <code>text</code>.</p>
```

###Â Example 2

```html:
<p>We can also talk about a line of CSS by using <b>code</b>:</p>
<code>background-color: red</code>
```

## Research small tag

I did some research on Google

[html small tag w3](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+small+tag+w3)

and found

[HTML small tag](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_small.asp)

and

[html small tag mdn](https://www.google.com/search?q=html+small+tag+mdn)

and found

[HTML small tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/small)

## Notes

The `<small>` tag defines smaller text (like copyright and other side-comments.

## Example list

###Â Example 1

```html:
<table border="1" cellpadding="10">
  <tr>
    <td>This page has been written on 16th June 2022</td>
    <td>Credits</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>It was created in order to display the usage of <b>small</b> tag.</td>
    <td>
      <small> &copy; Maria C 2022 </small>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

```html:
<table border="1" cellpadding="10" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td>

      and understand HTML, CSS, JavaScript and more

[HTML sub tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sub)

## Notes

The `<sub>` tag defines subscript text. Subscript text appears half a character below the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.

Appropriate use cases for `<sub>` include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

- marking up footnote numbers.
- marking up the subscript in mathematical variable numbers (although you may also consider using a MathML formula for this).
- denoting the number of atoms of a given element within a chemical formula (such as every developer's best friend, C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>10</sub>N<sub>4</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, otherwise known as "caffeine").

## Example list

###Â Example 1

```html:
<table border="2" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="16">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Name of compound</b>
    </td>

    <td>
      <b>Formula</b>
    </td>

    <td>
      <b>Atom in each molecule</b>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Ammonia</td>
    <td>NH<sub>3</sub></td>
    <td>1 nitrogen, 3 hydrogen</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Carbon dioxide</td>
    <td>CO<sub>2</sub></td>
    <td>1 carbon, 2 oxygen</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Methane</td>
    <td>CH<sub>4</sub></td>
    <td>1 carbon, 4 hydrogen</td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>Sulfur dioxide</td>
    <td>SO<sub>2</sub></td>
    <td>1 sulfur, 2 oxygen</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

and found

[HTML sup tag](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/sup)

## Notes

The `<sup>` tag defines superscript text. Superscript text appears half a character above the normal line, and is sometimes rendered in a smaller font.

Appropriate use cases for `<sup>` include (but aren't necessarily limited to):

- displaying exponents, such as "x<sup>3</sup>." It may be worth considering the use of MathML for these, especially in more complex cases.
- displaying superior lettering, which is used in some languages when rendering certain abbreviations. For example, in French, the word "mademoiselle" can be abbreviated "M<sup>lle</sup>"); this is an acceptable use case.
- representing ordinal numbers, such as "4<sub>th</sub>" instead of "fourth." See Ordinal numbers for examples.

## Example list

###Â Example 1

```html:
<table border="2" cellspacing="5" cellpadding="16">
  <tr>
    <td>
      <b>Anne sent me a letter and it began like this:</b>
    </td>
  </tr>

  <tr>
    <td>
      <small>

          Anne Blake
          Manchester,
          UK
