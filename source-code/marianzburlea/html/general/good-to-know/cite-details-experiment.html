<h1>Meet <i>cite</i> and <i>details</i> tags</h1>

<h2>Cite tag</h2>
<p>
	The <b>&lt;cite&gt;</b> tag defines the title of a creative work (e.g. a book,
	a poem, a song, a movie, a painting, a sculpture, etc.).
</p>

<h3>Let's take a look at example 1</h3>

<img

	alt="Thepicture represents the painting called Mona Lisa"
	width="100"
	height="130"
/>
<p>
	<cite>Mona Lisa</cite>
	by Leonardo da Vinci. Painted in 1503.
</p>

<p>
	<b>
		As you can see, the name of the painting is different than the other words.
	</b>
</p>

<p>Code example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;cite>Mona Lisa&lt;/cite&gt;
    by Leonardo da Vinci. Painted in 1503.
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Let's take a look at example 2</h3>

<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>
			It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
		</p>
	</blockquote>

	<figcaption>
		First sentence in
		<cite>
			<a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/0.html">
				Nineteen Eighty-Four
			</a>
		</cite>
		by George Orwell (Part 1, Chapter 1).
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
	<b>
		I made use of <i>figure</i> tag to create the example above and where you
		can see the text that is written in <i>italic</i>, I have used the
		<i>a</i> tag, so go ahead and click on it.
	</b>
</p>

<p>Code example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;figure&gt;
    &lt;blockquote&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;
        It was a bright cold day in April, and the clocks were striking thirteen.
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/blockquote&gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
      First sentence in
      &lt;cite&gt;
        &lt;a href="http://www.george-orwell.org/1984/0.html"&gt;
          Nineteen Eighty-Four
        &lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;/cite&gt;
      by George Orwell (Part 1, Chapter 1).
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Details tag</h2>

<p>
	The <b>&lt;details&gt;</b> tag specifies additional details that the user can
	open and close on demand. The <b>&lt;details&gt;</b> tag is often used to
	create an interactive widget that the user can open and close. By default, the
	widget is closed. When open, it expands, and displays the content within.
</p>

<h3>Let's take a look at example 2</h3>

<p>
	<b>
		If we take a look at the example below, I have added the
		<i>open</i> attribute so that the details section is already open.
	</b>
</p>

<small>
	<b>
		*<i>open</i> is a boolean, therefore it has only two values: 'true' and
		'false'.
