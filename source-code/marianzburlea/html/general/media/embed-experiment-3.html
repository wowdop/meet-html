<h1>This is an video file embeded using the <i>embed</i> tag</h1>
<p>
  I made use of a simple <b>embed</b> tag and I changed the value for attribute
  <b>type</b> to <i>video/webm</i>
</p>

<embed
  src="../../../../public/video/remove-bg.mp4"
  width="100%"
  height="300"
  type="video/webm"
/>

<h2>Let's try something else</h2>
<p>
  Let's embed a different video file and style it with some border to make it
  more visible for an user.
</p>

<div>
  <h3>
    This video is representing how multiple people can work in the same time on
    Figma.
  </h3>

  <p>
    This allows people to become more efficient and the design can be finished
    earlier.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is also an advantage as this allows all the team members to access the
    design any time and see real time updates as long as they are connected to
    the internet.
  </p>
  <embed
    src="../../../../public/video/realtime-edit.mp4"
    type="video/webm"
    width="500"
    height="200"
  />
</div>

<p>Code example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
    div {
      border: 0.5rem dotted crimson;
      padding: 0.5rem;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;embed
    src="../../../../public/video/remove-bg.mp4"
    width="100%"
    height="300"
    type="video/webm"
  /&gt;

  &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;h3&gt;
      This video is representing how multiple people can work in the same time on
      Figma.
    &lt;/h3&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This allows people to become more efficient and the design can be finished
      earlier.
    &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      It is also an advantage as this allows all the team members to access the
      design any time and see real time updates as long as they are connected to
