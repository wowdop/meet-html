<p>This is a landscape picture:</p>
<img
  src="https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300"
  alt="A pretty random picture"
  width="200"
  height="250"
/>
<p>This is just a simple image as the task was a very simple one.</p>
<p>
  We can use other tags such as <b>figure</b> for a different layout in another
  experiment as an upgrade to this html tag.
</p>
<p>Code example:</p>
<pre>
  &lt;img
  src="https://picsum.photos/seed/picsum/200/300"
  alt="A pretty random picture"
  width="200"
  height="250"
/&gt;
</pre>
