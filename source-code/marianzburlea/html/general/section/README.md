## Notes

<section> is a generic sectioning element, and should only be used if there isn't a more specific element to represent it.

Also consider these cases:

- If the contents of the element represent a standalone, atomic unit of content that makes sense syndicated as a standalone piece (e.g. a blog post or blog comment, or a newspaper article), the <article> element would be a better choice.
- If the contents represent useful tangential information that works alongside the main content, but is not directly part of it (like related links, or an author bio), use an <aside>.
- If the contents represent the main content area of a document, use <main>.
- If you are only using the element as a styling wrapper, use a <div>. An unwritten rule is that a <section> should logically appear in the outline of a document.
