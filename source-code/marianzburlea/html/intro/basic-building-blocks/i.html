    <title>How to define italic text using html tag</title>
  </head>

  <body>
    <p>Mark up text that is set off from the normal prose in a document.</p>

    <p>
      The <b>i</b> tag defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The
      content inside is typically displayed in italic.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <b>i</b> tag is often used to indicate a technical term, a phrase from
      another language, a thought, a ship name, etc.
    </p>
    <p>Example:</p>
    <p>
      The <i>Titanic</i> sank during the night. So any people died, including my
      husband.
    </p>

    <p>Code:</p>
    <pre>
      The &lt;i&gt;Titanic&lt;/i&gt; sank during the night. So any people died, including my husband.
