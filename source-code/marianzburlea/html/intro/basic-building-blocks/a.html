    <h1>Welcome to link in HTML</h1>

    <p>
      A link in HTML is used to bridge together two resources: a page with an
      image, a page with another page and so on.
    </p>

    <p>
      Linking from a page of a web site to another page of the same web site is
      called <b>internal linking</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If a link from an web site points to a resource outside the web site of
      origin, than we can talk about external links.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to visit Google to do a search,
      <a
        style="color: rgb(86, 128, 23)"
        target="_blank"
        href="https://google.com"
        href="Click this link to visit https://google.com"
      >
        visit https://google.com
      </a>
      as this is an external link. Links that have a <b>target</b> attribute
      with the value of <b>_blank</b> will open on click the web page it points
      to in a new window.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you want to navigate to the basic page on this web site,
      <a style="color: red" title="Go to the Basics" href="basic.html">
        click here to jump to it straight away.
      </a>
