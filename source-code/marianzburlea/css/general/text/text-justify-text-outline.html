<h3>Example using text-justify:</h3>

<div>
	In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
	I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like
	criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this
	world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
</div>

<p>
	<b>Tip:</b> Resize the browser window to see how the value "justify" works.
</p>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;

  &lt;/style&gt;

	&lt;div&gt;
		In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that
		I've been turning over in my mind ever since. 'Whenever you feel like
		criticizing anyone,' he told me, 'just remember that all the people in this
		world haven't had the advantages that you've had.'
	&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h2>outline</h2>

<p>
	An outline is a line that is drawn around elements, outside the borders, to
	make the element "stand out".
</p>

<p>The outline property is a shorthand property for:</p>

<ul>
	<li>outline-width</li>
	<li>outline-style (required)</li>
	<li>outline-color</li>
	<li>
		If outline-color is omitted, the color applied will be the color of the
		text.
	</li>
</ul>

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Outlines differ from borders! Unlike border, the outline is drawn
	outside the element's border, and may overlap other content. Also, the outline
	is NOT a part of the element's dimensions; the element's total width and
	height is not affected by the width of the outline.
</p>

<h3>Example using outline:</h3>

<div class="outline">This text has some dotted outline.</div>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
	.outline {
		outline: 3px dashed olive;
	}
  &lt;/style&gt;

	&lt;div class="outline"&gt;This text has some dotted outline.&lt;/div&gt;

</pre>
