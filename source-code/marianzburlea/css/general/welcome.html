<h1>Welcome to the CSS playground</h1>
<p>
	CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS describes how HTML elements are to
	be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media. CSS saves a lot of work. It
	can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once. External stylesheets
	are stored in CSS files.
</p>
<p>
	With CSS, you can control the color, font, the size of text, the spacing
	between elements, how elements are positioned and laid out, what background
	images or background colors are to be used, different displays for different
	devices and screen sizes, and much more!
</p>
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements</li>

	<li>
		Internal - by using a &lt;style&gt; element in the &lt;head&gt; section
	</li>

	<li>
		External - by using a &lt;link /&gt; element to link to an external CSS file
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files.
