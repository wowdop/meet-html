<h1>
	@keyframes, animation, animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay,
	animation-iteration-count, animation-direction, animation-timing-function in
	CSS
</h1>

<h2>@keyframes</h2>

<p>The <b>@keyframes</b> rule specifies the animation code.</p>

<p>
	The animation is created by gradually changing from one set of CSS styles to
	another.
</p>

<p>During the animation, you can change the set of CSS styles many times.</p>

<p>
	Specify when the style change will happen in percent, or with the keywords
	"from" and "to", which is the same as 0% and 100%. 0% is the beginning of the
	animation, 100% is when the animation is complete.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Tip:</b> For best browser support, you should always define both the 0% and
	the 100% selectors.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> Use the <b>animation</b> properties to control the appearance of
	the animation, and also to bind the animation to selectors.
</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The <b>!important</b> rule is ignored in a keyframe.</p>

<p>
	<b>Note:</b> The <b>animation-duration</b>property defines how long an
	animation should take to complete. If the animation-duration property is not
	specified, no animation will occur, because the default value is 0s (0
	seconds).
</p>

<p>
	It is also possible to use percent. By using percent, you can add as many
	style changes as you like.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>animation-delay</b> property specifies a delay for the start of an
	animation.
</p>

<p>
	Negative values are also allowed. If using negative values, the animation will
	start as if it had already been playing for N seconds.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>animation-iteration-count</b> property specifies the number of times an
	animation should run.
</p>

<p>
	The <b>animation-direction</b> property specifies whether an animation should
	be played forwards, backwards or in alternate cycles.
</p>

<p>The a<b>animation-direction</b> property can have the following values:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
		normal - The animation is played as normal (forwards). This is default
	</li>
	<li>reverse - The animation is played in reverse direction (backwards)</li>
	<li>alternate - The animation is played forwards first, then backwards</li>
	<li>
		alternate-reverse - The animation is played backwards first, then forwards
	</li>
</ul>

The <b>animation-timing-function</b> property specifies the speed curve of the
animation. The <b>animation-timing-function</b> property can have the following
values:

<ul>
	<li>
		ease - Specifies an animation with a slow start, then fast, then end slowly
		(this is default)
	</li>
	<li>linear - Specifies an animation with the same speed from start to end</li>
	<li>ease-in - Specifies an animation with a slow start</li>
	<li>ease-out - Specifies an animation with a slow end</li>
	<li>ease-in-out - Specifies an animation with a slow start and end</li>
	<li>
		cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n) - Lets you define your own values in a cubic-bezier
		function
	</li>
</ul>
