		Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village
		sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, “Wolf!
		Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!”
	</p>

	<p>
		When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the
		wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when
		seeing their angry faces.

		“Don’t scream wolf, boy,” warned the villagers, “when there is no wolf!”
		They angrily went back down the hill.
	</p>

	<p>
		Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, “Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is
		chasing the sheep!” To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came
		running up the hill to scare the wolf away.

		As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly, “Save your frightened cry
		for when there really is a wolf! Don’t cry ‘wolf’ when there is no wolf!”
		But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill
		once more.
	</p>

	<p>
		Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock. Alarmed, he jumped
		on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, “Wolf! Wolf!” But the
		villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn’t come to
		help.

		At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn’t returned with
		their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping.
	</p>

	<p>
		“There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, ‘Wolf!’ but
		you didn’t come,” he wailed.
	</p>

	<p>
		An old man went to comfort the boy. As he put his arm around him, he said,
		“Nobody believes a liar, even when he is telling the truth!”

		There once was a king named Midas who did a good deed for a Satyr. And he
		was then granted a wish by Dionysus, the god of wine.
	</p>

	<p>
		For his wish, Midas asked that whatever he touched would turn to gold.
		Despite Dionysus’ efforts to prevent it, Midas pleaded that this was a
		fantastic wish, and so, it was bestowed.

		Excited about his newly-earned powers, Midas started touching all kinds of
		things, turning each item into pure gold.

	<p>
		But soon, Midas became hungry. As he picked up a piece of food, he found he
		couldn’t eat it. It had turned to gold in his hand.

<h2>The Fox and the Grapes</h2>

	<p>
		One day, a fox became very hungry as he went to search for some food. He
		searched high and low, but couldn’t find something that he could eat.
	</p>
	<p>
		Finally, as his stomach rumbled, he stumbled upon a farmer’s wall. At the
		top of the wall, he saw the biggest, juiciest grapes he’d ever seen. They
		had a rich, purple color, telling the fox they were ready to be eaten.
	</p>

	<p>
		To reach the grapes, the fox had to jump high in the air. As he jumped, he
		opened his mouth to catch the grapes, but he missed. The fox tried again but
		missed yet again.
	</p>

	<p>He tried a few more times but kept failing.</p>

	<p>
		Finally, the fox decided it was time to give up and go home. While he walked
		away, he muttered, “I’m sure the grapes were sour anyway.”
