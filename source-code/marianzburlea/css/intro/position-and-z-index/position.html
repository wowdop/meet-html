<h1>Position</h1>

<p>
	The <b>position</b> property specifies the type of positioning method used for
	an element (static, relative, absolute, fixed, or sticky)
</p>

<h2>Position Relative</h2>

<p>
	The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document, and
	then offset relative to itself based on the values of <b>top</b>,
	<b>right</b>, <b>bottom</b>, and <b>left</b>. The offset does not affect the
	position of any other elements; thus, the space given for the element in the
	page layout is the same as if position were static.
</p>

<div class="box" id="one">One</div>
<div class="box" id="two">Two</div>
<div class="box" id="three">Three</div>
<div class="box" id="four">Four</div>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
    .box {
      display: inline-block;
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background: red;
      color: white;
    }

    #two {
      position: relative;
      top: 20px;
      left: 20px;
      background: blue;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;div class="box" id="one"&gt;One&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="box" id="two"&gt;Two&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="box" id="three"&gt;Three&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class="box" id="four"&gt;Four&lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Position Absolute</h2>

<p>
	The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created
	for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to its closest
	positioned ancestor, if any; otherwise, it is placed relative to the initial
	containing block. Its final position is determined by the values of
	<b>top</b>, <b>right</b>, <b>bottom</b>, and <b>left</b>.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
	lines below me.
</p>

<p class="positioned">
	By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
	as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
	border width/height.
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
	separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
</p>

<br />

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
    .paragraph {
      background: aqua;
      border: 3px solid blue;
      padding: 10px;
      margin: 10px;
    }

    .positioned {
      position: absolute;
      background: yellow;
      top: 900px;
      left: 50px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;
    I am a basic block level element. My adjacent block level elements sit on new
    lines below me.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="positioned"&gt;
    By default we span 100% of the width of our parent element, and we are as tall
    as our child content. Our total width and height is our content + padding +
    border width/height.
  &lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;p class="paragraph"&gt;
    We are separated by our margins. Because of margin collapsing, we are
    separated by the width of one of our margins, not both.
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Position Fixed</h2>

<p>
	The element is removed from the normal document flow, and no space is created
	for the element in the page layout. It is positioned relative to the initial
	containing block established by the viewport, except when one of its ancestors
	has a transform, perspective, or filter property set to something other than
	none (see the CSS Transforms Spec), in which case that ancestor behaves as the
	containing block. (Note that there are browser inconsistencies with
	perspective and filter contributing to containing block formation.) Its final
	position is determined by the values of <b>top</b>, <b>right</b>,
	<b>bottom</b>, and <b>left</b>.
</p>

<small>
	This value always creates a new stacking context. In printed documents, the
	element is placed in the same position on every page.
</small>

<br />

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
    .parent4 {
      position: fixed;
      border: 1px solid blue;
      background-color: rgba(255, 200, 200, 0.5);
      width: 500px;
      height: 100px;
      bottom: 0;
      left: 0;
      right: 0;
    }

    .child4 {
      position: absolute;
      border: 1px solid red;
      top: 70px;
      right: 15px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;p&gt;
    The Parent4 element has position: fixed, and will NOT remain in the natural
    flow of the page. It will position itself according to the viewport. It will
    also act as anchor point for the absolutely positioned Child4 element:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div class="parent4"&gt;
    Parent4: position: fixed, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0.
    &lt;div class="child4"&gt;Child4: position: absolute, right: 15px, top: 70px&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<p>
	The Parent4 element has position: fixed, and will NOT remain in the natural
	flow of the page. It will position itself according to the viewport. It will
	also act as anchor point for the absolutely positioned Child4 element:
</p>
<div class="parent4">
	Parent4: position: fixed, bottom: 0, left: 0, right: 0.
	<div class="child4">Child4: position: absolute, right: 15px, top: 70px</div>
</div>
<br />
<br />
<br />
