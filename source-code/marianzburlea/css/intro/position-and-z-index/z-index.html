<h1>Z-index</h1>

<p>
	The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. An element with
	greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
	Note: z-index only works on positioned elements (position: absolute, position:
	relative, position: fixed, or position: sticky) and flex items (elements that
	are direct children of display:flex elements). Note: If two positioned
	elements overlap without a z-index specified, the element positioned last in
	the HTML code will be shown on top.
