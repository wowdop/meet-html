<h1>Max-width</h1>

<p>
	The <b>max-width</b> property defines the maximum width of an element. If the
	content is larger than the maximum width, it will automatically change the
	height of the element.
</p>

<h2>Example using <b>max-width</b></h2>

<div class="max-width">
	<p>Take a look at this example</p>
	<p>
		This is a very long paragraph and since we added a max-width, it takes the
		height as much as this element is and the width is fixed.
	</p>
</div>

<p>I made use of <b>max-width: 50px</b></p>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
  &lt;style&gt;
    .max-width {
      max-width: 50px;
    }
  &lt;/style&gt;

  &lt;div class="max-width"&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take a look at this example&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;
      This is a very long paragraph and since we added a max-width, it takes the
      height as much as this element is and the width is fixed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
</pre>

<h2>Min-width</h2>

<p>
	The min-width property defines the minimum width of an element. If the content
	is smaller than the minimum width, the minimum width will be applied. If the
	content is larger than the minimum width, the min-width property has no
	effect.
</p>

<p>
	<b><i>Note:</i></b> This prevents the value of the width property from
	becoming smaller than min-width.
</p>

<p class="min-width">
	This text is in a <b>p</b> tag that has a <b>min-width</b> set to 100px.
</p>

<p>Code example:</p>

<pre>
	&lt;style&gt;
    .min-width {
      min-width: 100px;
      color: red;
    }
	&lt;/style&gt;


  &lt;p class="min-width"&gt;
    This text is in a &lt;b&gt;p&lt;/b&gt; tag that has a &lt;b&gt;min-width&lt;/b&gt; set to 100px.
  &lt;/p&gt;
</pre>
