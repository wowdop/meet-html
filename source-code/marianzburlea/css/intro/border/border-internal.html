<h2>The Last Dinosaurs</h2>

<div id="container">
	<div>
		<p class="intro">
			In a lost land of tropical forests, on top of the only mountain in the
			region, trapped inside an old volcanic crater system, lived the last ever
			group of large, ferocious dinosaurs. For thousands and thousands of years
			they had survived all the changes on Earth, and now, led by the great
			Ferocitaurus, they were planning to come out of hiding and to dominate the
			world once more.
		</p>

		<p class="first-part">
			<b>Ferocitaurus</b> was an awesome Tyrannosaurus Rex who had decided they
			had spent too much time isolated from the rest of the world. So, over a
			few years, the dinosaurs worked together, demolishing the walls of the
			great crater. When the work was done, all the dinosaurs carefully
			sharpened their claws and teeth, in readiness to terrorise the world once
			again.
		</p>

		<p>
			On leaving their home of thousands of years, everything was new to them,
			very different to what they had been used to inside the crater. However,
			for days, the dinosaurs continued on, resolute.
		</p>

		<p id="friends">
			Finally, from the top of some mountains, they saw a small town. Its houses
			and townsfolk seemed like tiny dots. Never having seen human beings
			before, the dinosaurs leapt down the mountainside, ready to destroy
			anything that stood in their way...
		</p>

		<p>
			However, as they approached that little town, the houses were getting
			bigger and bigger... and when the dinosaurs finally arrived, it turned out
			that the houses were much bigger than the dinosaurs themselves. A boy who
			was passing by said: "Daddy! Daddy! I've found some tiny dinosaurs! Can I
			keep them?"
		</p>

		<p id="ending">
			And such is life. <b>The terrifying Ferocitaurus</b> and his friends ended
			up as pets for the village children. Seeing how millions of years of
			evolution had turned their species into midget dinosaurs, they learned
			that nothing lasted forever, and that you must always be ready to adapt.
